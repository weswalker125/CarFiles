CarFiles is essentially a script to modify the file/directory names to keep all the names consistent since they originate from different sources (iTunes/Amazon/Bandcamp, etc).

This is ever changing, usually on the fly just before updating the USB stick I keep in my car.

Coding standards be damned on this project!
